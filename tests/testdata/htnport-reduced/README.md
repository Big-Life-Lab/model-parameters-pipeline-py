# HTNPoRT - Model Export Files

This folder contains the model export files for the **Hypertension Population
Risk Tool (HTNPoRT)**, a diagnostic model designed to predict hypertension
probability in the community setting. HTNPoRT was developed using
population-based health survey data from Canada (Canadian Health Measures
Survey - CHMS).

## Purpose

HTNPoRT is intended to support decision-making regarding hypertension
prevention at both individual and population levels. The model predicts
hypertension probability for community-dwelling adults based on age, family
history, body mass index, and diabetes, while also providing SHAP-derived risk
profiles which showcase the most influential predictors towards the probability
value.

This folder provides the files required to implement and run the HTNPoRT
algorithm, including both raw coefficient files and a PMML file for deployment.

for documentation on model parameter csv files.

### Core Files

-   **model-export.csv:** An index file listing all other files required by
    the algorithm for deployment and execution.
-   **model-steps.csv:** Specifies the sequence of calculations to estimate the
    hypertension risk, from data preprocessing to final risk calculation.

### Variable Configuration Files

-   **variables.csv:** Descriptions of all variables used in the final model,
    including their data types, transformations, and roles.
-   **variable-details.csv:** Metadata and descriptive details for each
    variable, such as units and potential ranges.

### Transformation and Encoding Files

-   **center.csv:** Lists variables that were centered during model development.
-   **dummy.csv:** Defines categorical variables that were transformed into
    dummy variables.
-   **rcs.csv:** Specifies variables transformed using restricted cubic splines
    (RCS), including knot values.

### Model Coefficients and Predictions

-   **logistic.csv:** Sex-specific coefficients from the logistic regression
    model.
-   **interactions.csv:** Details the interaction terms included in the model.

### Deployment File

-   **HTNPoRT.pmml:** The Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) file for
    direct integration with compatible software.

## Model Card: HTNPoRT

### Model Details

-   **Developed by:** Rafidul Islam, Douglas G. Manuel, and collaborators.\
-   **Model Type:** Logistic regression model.\
-   **Version:** HTNPoRT
-   **Input:** Age, family history, body mass index, and diabetes.\
-   **Output:** Hypertension probability/risk (diagnosed or undiagnosed).\
-   **Model Format:** PMML (with CSV support).\
-   **License:** Apache License 2.0.
-   **Excel Calculator**: <https://osf.io/mjd7n/>

### Intended Use

-   **Primary Purpose:** Estimating baseline hypertension risk for public
    health planning and clinical decision support.\
-   **Intended Users:** Public health professionals, epidemiologists,
    clinicians, and community-dwelling adults.\
-   **Geographic Scope:** Canada.

### Limitations

-   **Data Source:** Derived from community health surveys; may underrepresent
    certain populations.\
-   **Self-reported Data:** Subject to recall bias.\
-   **Interpretation:** Predictive associations, not causal.

### Ethical Considerations

-   **Equity:** Comprehensive sociodemographic data included, but
    underrepresentation of certain populations remains possible.\
-   **Transparency:** Openly shared model and coefficients for independent
    validation.
